# Test a backup error when writing to storage location

[Operation]
Type=backup
Success=false
Error=Permission denied when trying to create ‘/local’.

[Duplicity]
Runs=status;dry;backup;

[Duplicity backup]
#ERROR 51 put /remote /local
Output=true

[Restic]
Runs=unlock;backup;

[Restic backup]
# Not a real error message restic would give. That would look more like:
# Fatal: unable to save snapshot: OpenFile: open /tmp/restic/snapshots/68244579f8142b9428f43f7fb56634fa47aa610e43f33c960323048f560d912e: permission denied
# But this works for now, just as proof of bubbling it up, and to match
# duplicity's format for the test runner's error matching. We don't currently
# parse restic's error, outside of detecting the leading 'Fatal:'
Output=Fatal: Permission denied when trying to create ‘/local’.
